## Getting Started

This project makes use of **Python**. To be able to run this project locally, all aforementioned packages must be installed first.


### Installing Dependencies


1. **Virtual Enviornment** - I recommend working within a virtual environment whenever using Python for projects. This keeps your dependencies for each project separate and organaized. Instructions for setting up a virual enviornment for your platform can be found in the [python docs](https://packaging.python.org/guides/installing-using-pip-and-virtual-environments/)

2. **PIP Dependencies** - Once you have your virtual environment setup and running, install dependencies while in the root directory.
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
This will install all of the required packages we selected within the `requirements.txt` file.


### Running the script
```
python3 script.py
```
